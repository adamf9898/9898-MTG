  //       I was previously doing this by calling processEscapedCharacters in the updateTemplatedNodes function, but the

  //       to do here (regarding the above note about this being used in the evaluateText function - and wanting to preserve

    There are two main steps in creating the tree:
    1. We split up the text into lines and collect all the data we need about each line (e.g. odds, line number, etc.) and tidy it up as necessary (e.g. .trim() it, or remove it completely if it's a comment). Then we group sets of lines that are below a function header into said function header. We create all the parent/child hierarchy links along the way.
    2. We turn all that node data into a neat "perchance tree" which has the properties required to make the DSL work nicely, and we attach all the perchance methods to each node. Then we return the root node in this tree.

  // IMPORTANT: Some curly functions may "return themselves" i.e. {a} may return "{a}" rather than "a" or "an" - this
  //            behaviour is allowable because evaluateText is called recursively until no unescaped curly/square blocks
  //            exist. The reason curly functions may do this is because parts of their arguments (the two strings either side of
  //            "{a}" in the case of the "{a}" function) may not have been evaluated yet, and it may rely on those parts having
  //            been evaluated. e.g. in the text "{a} [animal] is over there", {a} must wait until [animal] has been evaluated.
  // ALSO NOTE: previousEvaluationText is needed because (for example) if we evaluate "created {a}", there's nothing after {a} for
  //            us to detemrine whether we should use "a" or "an". But "created {a}" is still valid because they could be using it
  //            as part of a larger sentence. If `text` evaluates to `previousEvaluationText`, then we just return it rather than
  //            recuring infinitely.
  // ALSO NOTE: I had to change this so that instead of [passing through once and then checking if there are any unevaluated blocks that would
  //            require another pass-over], it does the recursion *within* the loop - otherwise things get executed out of order (e.g. assignment of
  //            variables and stuff). The user expects their variable assignments to happen in the order that the final output text is printed in.
  //            Edit: Oh, but I still need to recurse at the end, because some curly blocks like {a} may only be executable once all the blocks are
  //            joined together into one string.
  // ALSO NOTE: This function DOESN'T call processEscapedCharacters on the output. That must be called on the result.

  // NOTE: this function interprets some strings as numbers and casts them using Number()
  //       note that this is *just a shorthand*. The reason it's okay to do is because it
  //       only interprets strings as numbers if Number(that_number).toString() would return
  //       the same string anyway. If the user wants to do something like:
  //            prop = [this.age]/[this.height]
  //       then they should do this instead:
  //            prop = [this.age/this.height]
  //       because the prior will return something like "10/140" (i.e. a string, rather than a number)

  // remember: the lineText could have square blocks which can of course have equals signs in them.
