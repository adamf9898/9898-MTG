The language that **tabletop** simulator uses is called **LUA**.

Does anyone **know** or could **create** a **converter** that can take a **generator** created from the site **[perchance.org](https://perchance.org)** that can be used **successfully** in **LUA scripting on objects in tabletop simulator** ?
